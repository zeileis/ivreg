# Version 0.3-0

* Initial version of the `ivreg` package: An implementation of instrumental
variables regression using two-stage least-squares (2SLS) estimation, based on
the `ivreg()` function previously in the
[AER](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AER) package. In addition to standard
regression functionality (parameter estimation, inference, predictions, etc.)
the package provides various regression diagnostics, including hat values,
deletion diagnostics such as studentized residuals and Cook's distances;
graphical diagnostics such as component-plus-residual plots and added-variable
plots; and effect plots with partial residuals.

* An overview of the package, documentation, examples, and vignettes are provided
at <https://john-d-fox.github.io/ivreg/>.
